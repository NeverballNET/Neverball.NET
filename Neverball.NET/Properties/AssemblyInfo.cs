//  The original source code has been ported to .NET with deep assistance by AltSoftLab in 2015-2016
//  The solution source code based on and requires AltSDK (visit http://www.AltSoftLab.com/ for more info),
//  and is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty of any kind.
//
//  The solution can still require several optimizations: some OpenGL display lists has been removed and
//  render logic changed to be more transparent and be possible to port to other render engines (maybe
//  MonoGame or Unity). Also vector arrays can be used for positions, texture coords & colors. Audio is
//  not implemented directly, but all sound calls directed to Audio class.
//
//  Thanks so much to AltSoftLab for help!
